<p>To start, go to the Armory to set up your avatar. There, the Tailor will help you choose the outfit just for you. Then go to the Church to create your user name. Finally, go to the Palace to join the mission and get your first Quest. Each Quest has a different objective. To get help, simply tap the Friends bar. There, all of your friends will appear. If you don't have any friends, exit and go to the Charecter bar. There you can choose any of my friends to help you. Each charecter has a different Ability. Abilities are what make a charecter weaker or stronger than another.</p>
<p>   Supplies    </p>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Weapons</li>
<li>Avatar</li>
<p>These supplies come in the Backpack. This is located in the bottom center of your screen. The Avatar is from the Armory. Food gives you energy, water wards of goblins, and weapons keep you safe and help you keep Villagers safe. Villagers are unwilling women, children, and retired Questees. The retired Questees have the wisdom to tell you what to watch out for and give you shelter. You have the choice to trust or refuse the information and shelter. </p>
